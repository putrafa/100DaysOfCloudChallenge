## Cloud Computing

Today I studied :
1. Get to know Cloud Computing
2. Definition of Clouds
3. Cloud Type
4. Cloud Function

## Introduction

  Cloud Computing is a method of delivering various services over the internet. The resources in question are, for example, applications such as data storage, servers, databases, networks, and software. Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources. Cloud computing is a popular option because it has many advantages, such as reducing costs, increasing productivity, speed, efficiency, performance, and security. 
Example of using the Cloud :
  1. Storage, backup, data retrieval
  2. Build and test applications
  3. Analyze data
  4. Streaming audio and video

## Cloud Type

 1. Software-as-a-service (SaaS)

These licenses involves licensing a software application to its users. These licenses are usually provided via a pay-as-you-go or on-demand method. This type can be found in Microsoft Office's 365.

2. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)

This license involves a method for delivering a file from the operating system to servers and storage, via IP-based connectivity as part of an on-demand service. Clients don't need to buy software or servers. Popular examples of this type are Public Cloud from Indonesian Cloud and Microsoft Azure.

3. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS)

This license is touted as the most complex. PaaS is very similar to SaaS, but the biggest difference is that, instead of delivering software online, PaaS is actually a platform for creating software that is delivered over the internet.
