# Introduction Users, Group, and Pollicies
## IAM : Users and Group
IAM : Identity and Access Management

IAM stands for Identity and Access Management, it is a global service because in IAM it is made to define users in groups. When we create an account, we create a root account, and it has been created by default. In this root we use to manage our account. But then we don't have to use the account anymore, or even share it.

Like the example above, we have two groups in IAM. And the group contains only users, no other groups. The group contains only users. And in the picture above, there is 1 user who is not in the group. It's not a best practice, but it's something we can do on AWS. And also a user can belong to multiple groups.

## IAM : Permissions

Users and groups can be provided with what's called a JSON document. As shown below, this is what is called a policy, IAM policy.

That's how it looks.
