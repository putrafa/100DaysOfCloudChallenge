# Network Fundamental

## Computer Network
- Introduction to Computer Networks

Computer networks can also be called data sharing, so the function of this computer network is to make it easier for us to share information, data, and so on. In essence, a computer network is a relationship between 2 or more computers to communicate with each other.

- IP Address

IP Address is the address of a device in the form of numbers to be able to communicate with each other, or it can also be called a name. So in order for us to be able to share information and data we need an IP address. The IP address writing format is divided into 4 obtet (x.x.x.x) where each obtet is a decimal number starting from 0-255.

           IP Class A (0-126/8)
           IP Class B (128-191/16)
           IP Class C (192-224/24)

1. IP Public

      IP used on the Internet.

2. IP Private

      IP used to communicate in a local network (LAN).

- Subnetting

This subnetting is used to determine the effective prefix. The function of the prefix is to find out the number of IPs that we can use. Prefix (/)

      - Number of Hosts :
        /24 = 256
        /25 = 128
        /26 = 64
        /27 = 32
        /28 = 16
        /29 = 8
        /30 = 4
